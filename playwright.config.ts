/**

 * concurrent suites on one machine fight over a single server, and the symptoms
 * — `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` part-way through a run, a lazy chunk failing to
 * load, the app rendering its error boundary — look exactly like product bugs.
 * CI gives every job its own container and needs no override.

/**
 * Dummy Firebase credentials for the built app.
 *
 * `src/lib/firebase.ts` calls `initializeApp()` at module load, so with these
 * unset the SDK throws `auth/invalid-api-key` and the page renders blank —
 * there is no such thing as running this app with no Firebase configuration.
 * No child's record is ever requested: Phase 1 only visits public routes, and
 * both `useUserChildren` and `useFirebaseCollection` early-return on a null
 * user, so no database listener ever attaches. The two calls that do leave for
 * Google — the analytics web config, and the sign-in iframe Firebase Auth
 * loads proactively on a mobile user agent — are route-blocked instead, with
 * the reasoning in `e2e/fixtures/blockedHosts.ts`.
 *
 * Two traps, both of which cost an afternoon once:
 * - The SDK rejects an `apiKey` containing `:`, so the key below has none.
 * - `getDatabase()` without `VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL` falls back to
 *   `<projectId>-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com`, the us-central1 host, which is
 *   not where an `asia-southeast1` instance lives. Keep it set; both hosting
 *   workflows write it (the pull-request one only since #92).
 *
 * These are build-time values: Vite inlines `import.meta.env` when `webServer`
 * runs `vite build`, so they belong on `webServer.env`, not on `use`.
