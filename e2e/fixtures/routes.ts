/**
 * The two route lists, derived from the product's own allowlist.
 *
 * AUTH-01…04 and SEO-01/02 all need "which routes need signing in", and the
 * catalogue is explicit that they must derive it rather than restate it: a
 * hard-coded path list is a second vocabulary that stays green when someone
 * adds a route and forgets to classify it, which is the one failure
 * `routePolicy.ts` is shaped to prevent.
 *
 * Importing production modules into a spec works here because both are free of
 * runtime dependencies. `types/routes.ts` is a `const` object and two pure
 * functions; `routePolicy.ts` imports only types and re-exports `ServiceId`
 * with `export type`, which the transpiler erases. Neither pulls in React, a
 * stylesheet or the Firebase SDK, so a Node-side import of either costs
 * nothing and cannot fail for a reason unrelated to the test.
