 * can see what is being claimed without opening a second file (plan §9).
 *
 * The board is a page of Traditional Chinese prose with almost no landmarks:
 * the two freshness banners and the board summary are bare `<p>` elements, so
 * they are selected by the copy `RadarPage.tsx` renders. That copy is inline
 * JSX with no exported constant to import — where the page does have a
 * canonical source, such as `AGE_LABEL` and `STATUS_COPY`, it is imported
 * rather than retyped (plan §6).
