/**
 * The ten routes a visitor reaches without an account.
 *
 * Selectors and navigation only; the assertions live in the specs (plan §9).
 *
 * Two markers per route, because the suite asks two different questions of the
 * same page and one locator cannot answer both:
 *
 * - `content` — "this is the real page, not the intro page a blocked visitor
 *   would see". AUTH-03's oracle. The wordmark in the header is deliberately
 *   not used: `/littleexplorer/wiki` renders `LittleExplorer` in its `AppBar`,
 *   and so does the LittleExplorer intro page.
 * - `ready` — "the runtime data has arrived and the page is finished". What
 *   the layout invariants and the console sweep wait on before measuring:
 *   three of the ten fetch a data file after mount, and measuring the painted
 *   shell measures the wrong page.
 *
 * They coincide on some routes and diverge on others, so both are stated per
 * route rather than one being derived from the other.
