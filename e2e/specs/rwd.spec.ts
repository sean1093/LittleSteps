 * the diff; these four assert what a parent actually hits — a page that
 * scrolls sideways, a control too small to tap, a modal whose controls are off
 * the screen — and they survive a restyle that broke nothing.
 *
 * One test per route rather than one loop over all ten: the route is then in
 * the failure's title, and a broken page fails once instead of hiding the
 * nine behind it.
