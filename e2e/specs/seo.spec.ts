/**
 * SEO-01, SEO-02, SEO-03 — the crawl boundary over gated routes.
 *
 * `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` and one prerendered `index.html` per public page
 * are written by a `closeBundle` hook in `vite.config.ts`. Nothing else in the
 * repo verifies that hook: `src/common/seo/` has no unit tests, and if the hook
 * silently no-ops the site ships with no `robots.txt`, every gated
 * child-health route becomes crawlable, and nothing goes red. These three
 * cases run against the built `dist/` the preview server is already serving,
 * so the check costs one HTTP request each.
 *
 * All three assert the bytes on the wire, before any JavaScript runs — a
 * different mechanism from NAV-01, which asserts what the app sets after
 * hydration.
