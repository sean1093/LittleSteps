 * What kind of place is this nursing room in, and can a parent walk into it?
 *
 * The 國健署 dataset carries no venue type. Everything below is inferred from
 * the venue's registered name, which is the only field that describes the
 * place at all — so a category is a good guess, not a published fact. Names
 * are registered names, too: 「新光三越百貨股份有限公司台北天母分公司」 is a
 * department store and 「臺北大眾捷運股份有限公司-劍潭站」 is a metro station,
 * even though both read like a corporation. That is why the rule table below
 * is ordered and why every public-facing category is tested before `workplace`
 * and `school`.
 *
 * `isInternalVenue` is the one place the inference is joined to real evidence.
 * The map holds both 依法應設置 and 自願設置 venues; only the statutory list
 * (`room.statutory`, from the ODS the build script merges in) tells them apart.
 * A factory or a campus that is absent from that list is almost always
 * staff-or-student-only, but "almost always" is as strong as the data gets —
 * so the UI says the room looks like an internal one and never hides it by
 * default.

 * - `government`'s department suffixes (`處$`, `局$`, …) come after the
 *   specific public venues, so 文化局 stays culture and 衛生局 stays medical.
 * - Hotels resolve to `other` on purpose: a room inside a hotel is not a
 *   destination a parent filters for, and it is not a workplace either.
 * - `workplace` and `school` are last, because their patterns (公司, 校區)
 *   appear inside the registered names of shops, stations and hospitals.
