/**
 * The one place that knows what `trialDates` looks like in the database.
 *
 * It started as an array of `YYYY-MM-DD` strings, which the database stores
 * as an object keyed by index. Appending a day meant rewriting the whole
 * array, and a child is shared by design: two caregivers pressing "record
 * today" on the same food each replayed their own copy, and the second one
 * to land erased the first (#89). New rows keep the dates as a set,
 * `{ '2026-09-06': true }`, so a day is one leaf that `update()` merges.
 *
 * Legacy rows are never migrated, and a leaf write onto one leaves both key
 * shapes side by side: `{ 0: '2026-09-01', '2026-09-06': true }`. Every
 * reader goes through {@link trialDatesOf}, and every writer builds its
 * patch with {@link trialDatePatch}, so no consumer needs to know which of
 * the three shapes it holds.
