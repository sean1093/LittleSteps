 * the names by hand made the opposite mistake cheap: the new field would just
 * never be diffed, and the parent would edit it and watch it not save.
 *
 * What is left out is the data layer's: `id` and `createdAt` are the record's
 * identity, and `updateFoodTrial` stamps its own `updatedAt`, so the form's is
 * at best noise and at worst an older clock. `trialDates` is not a scalar and

/**
 * What one edit of a food trial actually changed.
 *
 * `before` is the snapshot the form opened with, never the live store. The
 * form submits every field it holds, so writing that record back whole
 * overwrites whatever the other caregiver changed while the form sat open —
 * and overwrites it with values this parent read before their own edit
 * started. Diffing against the opening snapshot keeps a field nobody here
 * touched out of the patch, and `update()` then merges the two edits instead
 * of picking a winner. The live store is the wrong base for the same reason:
 * a stale form resending a field it never had would diff clean against it and
 * silently delete the other caregiver's change.
 *
 * A cleared field is `null`, not absent. `undefined` means "leave this one
 * alone", so omitting it leaves the old value in the database and hands the
 * parent back the note they just deleted.
 *
 * Two fields are not scalars:
 *
 * - `trialDates` is a set of days, one leaf per day, so it goes through
 *   {@link trialDatePatch}. Writing the object whole would erase a day the
 *   other caregiver recorded while this form was open (#89).
 * - `allergyReactions` stays one array leaf, the way `toUpdatePaths`
 *   documents, but it is compared structurally. `changedFields` compares
 *   arrays by identity, so an untouched list reports as a change and gets
 *   re-sent on every save — and because that leaf is replaced whole, the
 *   re-send takes out the reaction the other caregiver just added.
