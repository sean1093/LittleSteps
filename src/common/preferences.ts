/**
 * Device-level view preferences.
 *
 * What a parent narrowed down last time: which county, which age band, which
 * tab. LittleGuard is a weekly habit, so without this the same two chips get
 * tapped fifty-two times a year to reach the same board; BabyOasis loses its
 * filters to the page reload a PWA does mid-outing.
 *
 * ## This store never holds child data — do not widen it
 *
 * Signing in is required for anything that reads or writes a child's records,
 * and there is deliberately no guest mode and no LocalStorage fallback for
 * child data anywhere in this app. `localStorage` is readable by any script on
 * the origin, survives signing out, and is shared by everyone who uses the
 * device. So a child's name, birthday, id, or any record of theirs must never
 * be written here — not as a convenience, not as a cache, not "just the id".
 *
 * Everything in `ViewPreferences` is a view choice a stranger reading the blob
 * learns nothing personal from, and `OWNED_KEYS` is what enforces that rather
 * than this comment. The key set is closed in both directions: a write copies
 * the owned fields by name, so a caller that widened its own object cannot
 * smuggle a field through, and a read discards the entire blob if it carries
 * any key this module does not own. `preferences.test.ts` asserts both, and
 * asserts that the persisted payload never contains a child-shaped key.
 *
 * Where a preference is *derived* from a child — LittleGuard's age band, which
 * a signed-in parent gets from their child's birthday — the derived value stays
 * in memory and is never saved. Only a parent's own tap is stored.
 *
 * ## Versioned key
 *
 * The key carries a shape version. A blob written under an older version is
 * never migrated and never parsed: it is simply not read, and every surface
 * falls back to the default it had before this module existed. Within a
 * version, a value that no longer makes sense is dropped field by field. These
 * are public pages; nothing in a parent's `localStorage` may be able to break
 * one.
