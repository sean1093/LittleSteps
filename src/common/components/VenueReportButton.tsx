 * the door is locked, the hours are wrong. A report like that has to start
 * from the record the parent is looking at, or they end up copying the name
 * and the address out of the screen they just left.
 *
 * Visible, and tappable, while signed out. The rules require `auth != null`
 * to write a feedback record, but that governs what happens after the tap —
 * it is not a reason to hide the entry point, and hiding it is exactly why a
 * parent standing at a locked door currently has nowhere to go.
 *
 * `useOptionalAuth` rather than the strict hook: this button hangs off the
 * family-centre card and the nursing-room sheet, and both of those are mounted
 * on their own in unit tests, where there is no `AuthProvider`. No context
 * means signed out — which is the state this button most needs to explain.

    Whether the form has ever been opened from this button.

    The family-centre list renders 30 cards, so an unconditional portal put 30
    empty positioned nodes on `body` and mounted 30 `FeedbackModal` instances
    behind them on every list render - for a form a parent opens at most once.
    Latching on first open instead of guarding on `isOpen` costs one boolean
    and keeps the closing animation: `ModalFrame` runs its exit inside its own
    `AnimatePresence`, which needs the subtree to still be mounted while
    `isOpen` goes false. Guarding on `isOpen` unmounts it in the same frame and
    the sheet vanishes instead of sliding away - the exact mistake documented
    on `RoomDetailSheet`.

      {/* Portalled to `body`, the same way `AccountButton` portals the account
          sheet, and for the same two reasons.

          Positioning: the nursing-room detail sheet is a framer-motion bottom
          sheet, so it carries a transform and clips its overflow. A
          `position: fixed` modal rendered inside it is measured against that
          sheet instead of the viewport, and clipped to its 70vh box — the
          backdrop dimmed only the sheet, and a taller form would have been cut
          off at the top.

          Layer: BabyOasis stacks its own overlays at z-[1500] and z-[2000] to
          clear Leaflet's panes, so once portalled the default z-50 renders
          underneath the map. z-[2500] is the layer the account sheet already
          uses for exactly this; the toast stays above at z-[3000] so the
          confirmation is still readable. */}
