 * Returns to the app entry point at `#/`, where every service has a card.
 *
 * Navigation here has two levels: each service has its own home
 * (`#/littlesteps`, `#/littleexplorer`, …) reached by that service's own
 * chrome, and above them sits the entry point listing all services. This
 * button is the second level only — a service's own home button must not be
 * replaced by it.
 *
 * Uses a grid icon rather than a house so it reads as "all services" and stays
 * visually distinct from a service's own home button sitting beside it.
 *
 * Navigates by writing location.hash, so it needs no callback prop — App.tsx
 * already listens for hashchange.
