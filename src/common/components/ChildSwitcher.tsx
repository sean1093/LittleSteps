 * Names the child a screen is about, and switches child in two taps.

 * Switching used to exist in exactly one place, the account sheet, so on every
 * screen that is about one child the sequence was: tap the account button,
 * wait for the sheet, tap the child, watch the sheet close. Three taps and an
 * animation, a dozen times a day for a two-child household. And none of those
 * screens said whose record was open, so a feed could be typed onto the wrong
 * child and the clinic summary and growth chart would inherit the mistake.
 *
 * Two deliberate silences:
 *
 * - An account with nothing else to switch to renders nothing at all. A
 *   control with one option is noise, and the account sheet already names the
 *   child.
 * - Pregnancy profiles are never offered. They are child profiles, but the
 *   screens carrying this switcher all record a born baby and PregnancyGate
 *   replaces them with an explanation when the selected profile is a
 *   pregnancy — so offering one here would swap the page for that gate and
 *   take the switcher away with it. The account sheet keeps the full list,
 *   which is where the whole roster, adding a child and joining by code
 *   belong.
 *
 * The panel expands in flow rather than floating: it is a disclosure like the
 * app's other accordions, so there is no overlay to stack, clip or trap focus
 * inside.
