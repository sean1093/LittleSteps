 * ones inside arrays: the food trial form sends
 * `allergyReactions: [{ description: undefined }]` whenever the parent leaves
 * the note blank, and the SDK refused the whole write over that one property
 * (#91). Primitives pass through.
 *
 * An array element that is itself `undefined` is left in place rather than
 * dropped. The database stores an array as an object keyed by index, so
 * removing the element would shift every later one and quietly change which
 * reaction `allergyReactions/1` is. The SDK still rejects such a write and
 * names the index, which is the useful failure. No caller builds one today.
