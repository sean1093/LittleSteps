/**
 * The one page header.
 *
 * There were three, and they disagreed about everything that matters: the
 * LittleSteps bar was white with a hamburger, LittleBloom's was a solid
 * dusty-rose band with white text (2.16:1 — the title was hard to read),
 * LittleExplorer's was white with a gradient icon badge that never changed
 * across its four tabs. Container widths were `max-w-3xl` and `max-w-4xl` for
 * no reason anyone wrote down.
 *
 * Structure is now identical everywhere and a service's personality comes from
 * its `ServiceTheme` — the title ink and the page background underneath. A
 * white bar keeps the coloured content below it as the thing you look at, and
 * costs a phone ~20px less vertical space than a tinted band.
 *
 * The identity icon that used to sit on the left of every single screen is
 * gone: the wordmark already says which app you are in, and on a 375px screen
 * that badge was competing with the title for the only row that matters.
