/**
 * "Nothing here yet", said once.
 *
 * There were fourteen of these in the sub-apps plus eleven more in LittleSteps,
 * and between them they used ten different 64px grey icons, three different
 * layouts, and two different ideas about whether the block should be centred in
 * the viewport or top-anchored.
 *
 * No icon by default. A big muted glyph above a sentence is the house style of
 * every generated template, it says nothing the sentence doesn't, and on a
 * phone it pushes the one useful thing — the action — below the fold. `icon` is
 * kept for the moments that genuinely earn a picture: a birth, a birthday, a
 * graduation. Those are warm; a grey clock over "no records yet" is not.
