/**
 * A parent telling us that a published venue record is wrong.
 *
 * The three fully public services run on datasets nobody here can verify: the
 * MOHW nursing-room map, and a family-centre roster published as a PDF with no
 * opening hours for most counties. The app already carries that honestly — it
 * labels rooms that look staff-only, and says outright when a county's access
 * rules are unverified — but all of it is inference. The parent standing at
 * the door is the only source of truth that exists for "is it still there" and
 * "can I get in", so the report has to cost them one tap and one choice.
 *
 * Why the context travels as text, not as columns
 *   The report is written as the `title` and `content` of an ordinary feedback
 *   record. `database.rules.json` validates `feedbacks/$feedbackId` field by
 *   field and rejects anything else (`"$other": { ".validate": false }`), so a
 *   `venueId`/`reason` pair of columns is a rules change — and that file is the
 *   only real authorisation boundary in the product, so changing it without
 *   `npm run test:rules` behind it is a guess. Composing the context into the
 *   two fields the inbox already reads keeps the write inside a shape that is
 *   already proven, and a human triaging it still gets the venue id, the name
 *   and the disputed claim without the parent having typed any of them.
 *
 * Reports are an inbox, not a data source. Nothing here feeds back into what
 * the map or the venue list shows; the build scripts stay the source of truth
 * until somebody verifies a report and edits the pipeline.
