/**
 * The landmark contract for standalone routes, checked where the E2E suite
 * cannot go.
 *
 * `isStandaloneSubApp` (see `routePolicy.ts`) is a promise: `App.tsx` stops
 * supplying a `<main>`, so every page under those prefixes must bring its own.
 * A11Y-01/02 prove that in a browser, but the suite runs signed out and five of
 * these routes early-return an intro page while signed out, so those five are
 * never visited in the state the contract is about. This has already gone wrong
 * once: an `about` route joined the list while PR #79 was open, `AboutPage` had
 * no `<main>`, and only a merge conflict noticed.
 *
 * Why a source scan. The alternative is mounting each page, and each one wants
 * a child profile, a Firebase listener and a fetch of its own — a fixture per
 * service, for an assertion about one element. The scan is cheap and the thing
 * it guards is structural.
 *
 * What makes it worth having is that nothing here is written down twice. The
 * page list is `ROUTE_PATH` filtered through the predicate itself, and the
 * component each page renders is read out of `App.tsx`, so a seventh service
 * arrives in this test the moment it arrives in the product. A hand-copied
 * list would be a second vocabulary that goes stale on exactly the day it
 * matters, which is the failure this exists to catch — so a page this file
 * cannot resolve fails loudly rather than being skipped.
